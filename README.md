## Project Description
With the help of the pizza delivery app Slice, users can simply make orders and check the status of deliveries while also connecting with nearby pizzerias. Customers may tailor their purchase and delivery preferences using a variety of settings available through the app's user-friendly design. Through the app, users can simply explore menus, modify their meals, and place orders.

## Features
1. Online and Mobile Ordering: Customers can place orders through the app or the website, and can easily browse menus and customize their orders. Users can also save their preferred pizzerias and past orders for quick and easy access in the future.

2. Multiple Payment Options: Slice offers a range of payment options, including credit card, PayPal, and in-app wallet. Customers can easily switch between payment options, save their preferred payment method, and view their transaction history.

3. Delivery Tracking and Scheduling: Customers can track their delivery in real-time, and receive notifications when the order is being prepared, picked up, and delivered. Customers can also schedule their deliveries for a specific time and date, and choose from various delivery options such as express or standard delivery.

4. User Account Management: Customers can create and manage their accounts, save their preferred pizzerias, and view their transaction history. Additionally, customers can leave ratings and reviews for pizzerias, and share their feedback with other users.

5. In-App Chat: Customers can communicate with the pizzeria through in-app chat feature, where they can ask for clarifications on menu items, request special requests and ask for any other information. Pizzerias can also communicate with customers, for example, to inform them about any delays or special promotions.

6. Customizable Orders: Customers can customize their orders and choose from a wide range of toppings, crusts, and sizes, as well as add special requests such as extra cheese or garlic knots.

7. Order History: Customers can view their past orders and easily reorder their favorite items.

8. Promotions and Offers: Customers can view special promotions and offers from pizzerias and apply them to their orders.
